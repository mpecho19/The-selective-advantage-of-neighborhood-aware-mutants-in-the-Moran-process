# The-selective-advantage-of-neighborhood-aware-mutants-in-the-Moran-process

This repository contains the source code and scripts used to generate the figures for the paper **"The selective advantage of neighborhood-aware mutants in the Moran process"**.

Each Python script in the root directory corresponds to a specific figure in the paper.

Running a script will generate the plot and save it automatically into the `paper_figures/` directory.

The code was originally developed and tested using **Python 3.14.0**.

You can use `pip` to install the necessary dependencies.
